    <p><i>Katsudon that's crispy and juicy at the same time. This recipe has a simple trick that can elevate the dish infinitely.</i></p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Pork shoulder/loin steak or filleted chicken breast/thigh (150g)</li>
        <li>1 white onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 cup AP flour</li>
        <li>Neutral oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 cups panko breadcrumbs </li>
        <li>½ cup AP flour</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt </li>
        <li>1 cup stock (dashi, chicken, veggie all works!)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sake</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mirin </li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat the meat down with a kitchen towel. Using the back of your knife or a meat hammer, tenderize the meat. Aim for the meat to be in even thickness to ensure that the katsu cooks evenly</li>
        <li>Season the meat with a generous amount of kosher salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Prepare the assembly line: pour flour into a rimmed baking tray, batter in a bowl, and panko into a baking tray. /li>
        <li>Heat your oil on medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Coat the meat in the flour. Make sure to get every side coated. Dust off any excess flour. (Use right hand)</li>
        <li>Drop the floured meat into the batter. Coat both sides. Let excess batter drip off. (Use left hand)</li>
        <li>Tightly pack the cutlet with panko. Press down firmly so that the panko can stick on.</li>
        <li>Test the oil temp. If you don't have a thermometer, drop a bit of the batter into the oil. The batter should sink to the middle for half a second and pop right up to the top sizzling. If you have a thermometer, aim for 180C/ 355F. The oil temperature is slightly higher than your average frying temperature at this point because we're accounting for the meat to drop the temperature to around 176C / 350F.</li>
        <li>Gently drop the katsu away from your body so that the oil won't splatter on you.</li>
        <li>Fry on each side for 2 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Crank the heat up high for the final 30 seconds before taking the katsu out on a wired baking tray. </li>
        <li>Let the katsu rest. This resting process helps the meat absorb its juices and residual heat to make the katsu crispier.</li>
        <li>In a small nonstick pan or a donburi pan, add the sauce.</li>
        <li>Heat on high until the sauce starts simmering.</li>
        <li>Add half of the sliced onions. Cook until the onions have turned slightly translucent.</li>
        <li>Beat one egg. Do not overbeat as this will incorporate too much air.</li>
        <li>Drizzle in the egg mixture on top of the sauce in a circular motion, starting from the center.</li>
        <li>Cook the mixture for additional 30 seconds. Turn the heat off when the egg is still runny in the center. The residual heat will cook the egg.</li>
        <li>Cut the katsu into bite-sized pieces. Place on top of rice.</li>
        <li>Gently pour the sauce on top. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
